# Clinically Verified Hybrid Deep Learning System for Retinal Ganglion Cells Aware Grading of Glaucomatous Progression

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
We present a novel strategy encompassing a hybrid convolutional network RAG-Net<sub>v2</sub> that extracts the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell with the inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) and GCC regions, allowing thus a quantitative screening and grading of glaucomatous subjects. Furthermore, RAG-Net has additionally been tested to screen the glaucomatous cases through retinal fundus images. The block diagram of the proposed framework is presented below:
